# Hi there 👋
✨ My name is Mateo Contreras and I am an economist from Los Andes University currently working as a Jr. Data Analyst at Davivienda Bank. I am looking forward to continue growing in the Data Analytics industry as i think it is key to provide useful insights through KPIs, data pattern exploring and data visualization.


## Interest
🔭 I am currently learning and implementing Machine Learning algorithms 🤖 such as Random Forests, LM, XGBoost, (...).

:seedling: I am also improving my dexterity in R and Python :snake: and learning SQL. I would like to learn C++ too as it is a faster programming language for big data management.

:blue_book: I want to learn Cloud computing ☁️ such as Azure and AWS.
